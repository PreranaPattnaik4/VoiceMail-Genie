## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```

Next, set up your environment variables. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your Google Gemini API key:

```
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Now, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
